<h3 id="AddStop">AddStop.java</h3>
<p>Adds stop into permanent database<br>
Requires entry of agency code, stop ID, name, latitude, longitude coordinates<br>
Looped for infinite entry of stops</p>

<h3 id="AgencyMap">AgencyMap.java</h3>
<p>Generates agency maps<br>
Maps planned to go public in Spring 2024<br>
Loops through indiviudal agencies, outputs KML files (maps/map-agency.kml)</p>

<h3 id="Calculator">Calculator.java</h3>
<p>The main calculator behind this whole project.<br>
The most hodgepodge hackjob of a program.<br>
<br>
<b>agency()</b><br>
Asks for agency to search / input<br>
Checks against list of current agencies to check if valid<br>
Loops if invalid agency is entered<br>
If valid, passes to edi()<br>
<br>
<b>edi()</b><br>
Bulk of the calculator<br>
<br>
<u>Asks for line choice</u><br>
If searching for existing line, will pull up that line<br>
There are special cases below<br>
Line choice -00, exits calculator<br>
Line choice set, pulls line from old set, applicable agencies only, and asks for set name<br>
<br>
<u>Line choice custom</u><br>
Enter new line into database<br>
Loads stop listing from agency (stops/agency.txt)<br>
Two separate ArrayLists, stops2 for EDI file, custom for ending display, stops2 has more data<br>
Asks for line code, name, and branch name, if applicable, Main if not<br>
Loop to ask for stop IDs along route<br>
<br>
<u>Special stop IDs:</u><br>
Stop ID -1, custom stop, asks for code, name, latitude, longitude<br>
Stop ID -2, removes previous stop<br>
Stop ID -3, adds stop from other agency, asks for agency code, stop ID<br>
Stop ID -0, ends line<br>
Stop ID segment, adds segment of existing line, reverse to add in reverse (see below for further documenation)<br>
<br>
Passes each stop added to rollingEDI() (see further documenation below)<br>
Prompt to save custom line, if yes, stops2 saves to agency EDI file (files/agency-edi.txt) and EDI list file (edis/agency.txt)<br>
Prompt to export custom line, if yes, displays all stop IDs in order, along with agency and route codes<br>
<br>
<u>Line choice segment</u><br>
Calculates EDI for segment of existing line<br>
Loads in EDI file (files/agency-edi.txt)<br>
Prompts for line code, starting stop, ending stop numbers (not codes)<br>
Invalid if segment length is 0<br>
<br>
<u>Line choice reverse</u><br>
Reverses line of segment (see above documenation)<br>
Does the exact same thing and then reverses line<br>
<br>
<u>Other line choice</u><br>
Checks if valid line code<br>
Prints details of that line<br>
<br>
All searches go through rollingEDI() (see documenation below)<br>
Haversine formula loop for whole line<br>
There's a hackjob for old bug of EDI less than 1<br>
Displays distance in miles, EDI, and average stop spacing in miles<br>
<br>
<b>rollingEDI()</b><br>
The comment is correct, this was created at 1 in the morning as one of Ben's crazy ideas<br>
Calculates distance and EDI cumulatively along line as being entered<br>
Also shown as part of full line display<br>
Runs line up to certain amount of stops through haversine formula<br>
<br>
<b>calcIndex()</b><br>
Clone of rollingEDI() to only return EDI value<br>
<br>
<b>saveIndex()</b><br>
Clone to directly calculate index value for ImportIndex.java (see documenation below)<br>
Adds new line to EDI file (files/agency-edi.txt) and EDI list file (edis/agency.txt)</p>

<h3 id="FullMap">FullMap.java</h3>
<p>Same as AgencyMap.java (see documenation above) but creates map of all agencies<br>
Loops through each agency to produce one file (maps/map-all.kml)</p>

<h3 id="HasIndex">HasIndex.java</h3>
<p>Searches database for routes with certain EDI value<br>
Asks for value<br>
value range, asks for low and high ends, searches for all within that range</p>

<h3 id="ImportIndex">ImportIndex.java</h3>
<p>Internal use program<br>
Takes file exported from outside GTFS reader and imports all files into EDI<br>
Pushes to Calculator.saveIndex()<br>
Asks for agency code and import code</p>

<h3 id="PopulationData">PopulationData.java</h3>
<p>Largely for internal use, no plans to make public as of March 2024<br>
Connects EDI data to US Census to find population served<br>
Only supports agencies within the US<br>
Constructor for data pushed from StopInfo.java (see documenation below)<br>
Choice between population served by stop or line<br>
Checks if valid agency within the US (zz- used internally for other purposes)<br>
Asks for agency and radius between 0.125 and 1.0 miles<br>
<br>
<u>Choice stop</u><br>
Loads in agency stop file (stops/agency.txt)<br>
Asks for stop<br>
<br>
<u>Choice line</u><br>
Loads in EDI file (files/agency-edi.txt)<br>
Asks for line<br>
Can also search for segment of line<br>
<br>
Finds all points within selected radius of all stops on line chosen, or single stop<br>
Finds points in increments of 0.125 miles and 45 degrees<br>
Runs all coordinates through US Census geocoder to find state, county, tract, block<br>
Checks for duplicates<br>
Adds all population totals by block<br>
Looped for infinite searches</p>
