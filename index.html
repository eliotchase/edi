<h1>Eliot Deviation Index</h1>
<p>What if there was a measure of how straight a transit line's routing is? 
  How direct is this routing? I had those questions on the afternoon of May 3, 2022. 
Those were the fundamental questions behind the Eliot Deviation Index - the measure that 
answers those questions. Put simply, the Eliot Deviation Index of a transit route is the 
ratio between the line distance and the displacement. Read the <a href=https://transit.benchase.info/2022-05/eliot-deviation-index.html>
release blog post</a> for the more technical stuff behind it.</p>

<p><b>Eligibility</b><br>
Not every transit line is eligibile for an Eliot Deviation Index. 
There are three criteria that all routes must meet. <br>
1. The line must begin and end at different stops. No loops allowed. <br>
2. The line must have at least three stops. <br>
3. The line must not end along the return journey to the beginning.</p>

<p><b>Special Thanks</b><br>
The Eliot Deviation Index could not have made it this far without some help. <br>
Thanks to those first interested in the measurement in May 2022, when there were only 300 
stops in our database. <br>
Thanks to those who questioned the definition of this measurement, in order for me to 
further clarify what is eligibile and what is not. Not every bus route is the same. <br>
Thanks to the team at my high school who allowed me to tell the story of the Eliot Deviation 
Index to the rising seniors in the class of 2023. <br>
Thanks to Stormy Kara for providing the stop listings for various CTA and Pace bus routes.</p>
